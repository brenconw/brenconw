Heyyyyyyy. I´m an artist based in Argentina. I´m finishing my degree on Visual Arts and looking forward to start a postgraduate degree in blended languages.
I´m very curious and find a lot of topics very magical. I could be talking for HOURS. I´m funnier in my main language but manage pretty ok in english. 
I recently tasted working in group for a gamejam and it was very interesting and fun. I guess i will be joining jams for a while.
My referents for artwork (traditional and digital) are:
Moshe Linke, David Umemoto, On Kawara, Jonathan Blow, Carlos Coronado, Guillermo Kuitca, Alfredo Portillos, American McGee, Zdzisław Beksiński, Jeroen Taal
...well there is more but I should stop.
In my artwork i explore time and space, liminality, memory, ruins, abandoned places, topology, it´s all pretty weird but I hope it´s also magical.
